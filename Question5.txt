Point 1 -

Topic area

 1) Identify restaurants around NJ Transit Train Stations
 

Functional Scope 

 1) Show searchable option for user to pick any train station, and browse through nearby restaurants.
 2) Upon selection of any restaurant, show a map that has the selected restaurant in the view
 3) Have option to select one ore more restaurant and notify people
 
 What makes it useful
 
 1) Targets NJTransit Train commuters that are looking to stop by at some take away place on the way to home. 
 2) Allows user to save restaurants that they have visited before, or mail / msg the current restaurant location to a friend so that the user gets picked up.
 3) Features in-built mail / messaging capability. For instance, one can select a restaurant and mail location coordinates to the spouse. This can be an information for a pick up or to join for the dinner.
 
 What features must exist for the App to make any sense?
 
 1) App requires NJ Transit train station data that has location information.
 2) App will use Yelp API to find restaurants from a given train station.
 3) App will need mail / msg capability 
 4) App will save NJ Transit data if it's the first time user, and also allow saving restaurants.
 
  What additional features are you thinking about and how realistic are they?
  
  1) I'm thinking to plug-in Uber API, so that user could use a cab to get to the restaurant.
  2) When the user navigates from Train Station -> Restaurant Screen -> Map View, I would like to show 2 sets of data. The first annotation on map will be Red in color that shows the train station. The second annotation will be all restaurants that are corresponding to the train station.
